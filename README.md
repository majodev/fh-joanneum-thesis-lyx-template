# fh-joanneum-thesis-lyx-template
> This LyX template was extracted from my master thesis at [FH JOANNEUM University of Applied Sciences](http://www.fh-joanneum.at), Graz, Austria. You may use it as a starting point for your own thesis.

This is an **unofficial template**, that is/was compliant to the thesis specs of the FH JOANNEUM [information management degree programme](http://www.fh-joanneum.at/aw/home/Studienangebot_Uebersicht/department_angewandte_informatik/~oya/ima/?lan=de) in 2013 and 2014.

## Usage
- Setup a proper TeX Environment ([TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) on Windows and Linux or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) on MAC OS X)
- Get [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/) (> 2.0.6).
- Open `thesis.lyx` and use the "preview goggles" or export to PDF via `File > Export > PDF (pdflatex)`.

## Structure
The supplied folder structure is only a recommendation. However, I have a feeling that the separation of references into "books", "papers" and "internet sources" is very useful.

In order to cite correctly, make yourself familiar with [BibTeX](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/BIBTEX.HTM).

## Example output
![thesis template example image](thesis.png)
The compiled PDF looks like [this](thesis.pdf).  
Your finished thesis might look like [mine here](http://ranf.tl/static/masterthesis/Diplomarbeit_Mario_Ranftl.pdf).  

> Good luck writing your thesis!
