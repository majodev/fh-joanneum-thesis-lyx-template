  abstract="This paper presents a real‐time remote robot teleoperation method using markerless Kinect‐based hand tracking. Using this tracking algorithm, the positions of index finger and thumb in 3D can be estimated by processing depth images from Kinect. The hand pose is used as a model to specify the pose of a real‐time remote robotʹs end‐effector. This method provides a way to send a whole task to a remote robot instead of sending limited motion commands like gesture‐based approaches and this method has been tested in pick‐and‐place tasks.",
